Description: there are three simple functions in this program that use class database to manipulate with data and see results;
             working of functions is checked by some tests for threading database:

                first - sets and gets data;

                second and third - create some threads for readers and writers and
                                   check if they can work together and save the data correct;

                final - creates 99 reading threads and writing threading,
                        starts all the threads and checks if in the end data will be saved correct.
